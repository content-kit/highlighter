Highlighter is an Elixir package which can be used to highlight or
annotate text using a list of annotations.

## Project status

It's early stages for this project and it may not be "production ready"
â€“ for instance, there have been no performance benchmarks or
optimizations. Contributions are welcome!

## Usage

To use Highlighter, invoke `Highlighter.annotate/2` with a string and a
list of `Highlighter.Annotation`'s to apply to that string:

```elixir
test "three annotations (simple words)" do
  dog_annotation = %Highlighter.Annotation{start_pos: 0, end_pos: 3, open: "<woof>", close: "</woof>"}
  cat_annotation = %Highlighter.Annotation{start_pos: 8, end_pos: 11, open: "<meow>", close: "</meow>"}
  cow_annotation = %Highlighter.Annotation{start_pos: 16, end_pos: 19, open: "<moo>", close: "</moo>"}

  annotations = [dog_annotation, cat_annotation, cow_annotation]

  annotated = Highlighter.annotate("dog and cat and cow", annotations)

  assert annotated == "<woof>dog</woof> and <meow>cat</meow> and <moo>cow</moo>"
end
```
